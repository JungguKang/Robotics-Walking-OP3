# Robotics-Walking-OP3

## Description
This is a graduation project in Hanyang University, 2020.   
This project is about applying walking algorithm that was stated in SIMBICON paper to the robot OP3. 
## ROBOTICS
### ROS
In project we used ROS as a robot operating system. ROS is an open source meta-OS for robot. 
This provides several useful packages that could serve the message between the process, 
frequently used functionalities while dealing with robots, tool or library that could build, execute the code.
You can see the ROS official link in below.
